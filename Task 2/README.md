There is a survey tried to find out which of two brands of computers the customers prefer. However, the answer to the brand preference question was not properly captured for all of the respondents.
I used two different decision tree classification methods - C5.0 and RandomForest to predict customers' brand preference based on customer responses to some survey questions (e.g. income, age, etc.).
